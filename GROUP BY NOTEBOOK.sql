-- Certainly! Here are some practice questions related to the `GROUP BY` clause in SQL:

/*1. **Basic GROUP BY**:
   - Given a "Orders" table with columns (OrderID, CustomerID, Product, Quantity, and OrderDate), write a SQL query to find the total quantity of each product ordered.*/

select product,sum(quantity)
from orders
group by products;

/*2. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - In a "Sales" table with columns (Product, Category, Price, and QuantitySold), write a query to find the average price and total quantity sold for each product category.*/

select category,avg(price),sum(quantitysold)
from sales
group by category;

/*3. **GROUP BY with HAVING**:
   - Using a "Students" table with columns (StudentID, CourseID, and Grade), find the course(s) with an average grade higher than 90, and list the course name and its average grade.*/

select courseid,avg(grade)
from students
group by courseid
having avg(grade) > 90;

/*4. **Multiple Grouping Columns**:
   - In a "Employees" table with columns (EmployeeID, Department, Salary), find the highest salary in each department.*/

select department,max(salary)
from employees
group by department;


/*5. **GROUP_CONCAT or STRING_AGG**:
   - Using a "Orders" table with columns (OrderID, CustomerID, and Product), concatenate the names of products ordered by each customer, separating them with commas.*/

select  customerid,group_concat(product)
from orders
group by customerid;

/*6. **GROUP BY with DATE Functions**:
   - In a "Transactions" table with columns (TransactionID, CustomerID, Amount, and TransactionDate), group transactions by month and find the total amount for each month.*/

select date_format(transactiondate,"%Y-%m"),sum(amount)
from transactions
group by date_format(transactiondate,"%Y-%m");

/*7. **Subqueries and GROUP BY**:
   - Using a "Sales" table with columns (Product, Category, Price, and QuantitySold), find the products that have a price higher than the average price of their respective categories.*/

select category,product,price
from sales s1 join(
select category,avg(price)
from sales
group by category
) as s2
where s1.category = s2.category
and s1.price > s2.price;


/*8. **COUNT and NULL Values**:
   - In an "Employees" table with columns (EmployeeID, Department, and ManagerID), find the number of employees in each department, including departments with no employees.*/

select d.department,count(e.employeeid)
from (select distinct department
from employees) as d
left join employee e 
using (department)
group by d.department;

/*9. **GROUP BY with Joins**:
   - Given a "Customers" table (CustomerID, CustomerName) and an "Orders" table (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate), find the number of orders placed by each customer.*/

select c.customerid,count(orderid)
from customers c inner join orders o
using(customerid)
group by customerid;

/*10. **Advanced GROUP BY**:
    - In a "Products" table with columns (ProductID, Category, Price, and StockQuantity), find the product(s) with the highest price in each category.*/
